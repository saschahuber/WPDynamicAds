== Description ==

WP DynamicAds lets you configure ads that get displayed, when the currently displayed post contains a given keyword.
For example, if you configure an ad for the keyword "hosting" it gets displayed on all posts that contain the word "hosting".
You can also set a maximum number of ads that get displayed on a post.

The ads are ordered based on relevance to the current post. You can set multiple properties to configure the calculation of the relevance-score.

The content of your app is up to you, you can use images, plaintext and even shortcodes.
